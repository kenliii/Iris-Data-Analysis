# Iris Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project analyzes the famous Iris dataset, which contains the measurements of Iris flowers. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the characteristics of different iris species and their measurements.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset includes 150 samples with the following features:

- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)
- Species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. If you're using a virtual environment, activate it.
4. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the data analysis script (`data_analysis.py`), use the following command:

This will output the first few rows of the dataset, its overall structure, and basic statistical information. It will also generate a pair plot visualizing the relationships between different features for each species.

## Structure

- `data_analysis.py`: The main Python script with the data analysis.
- `requirements.txt`: A text file listing the libraries necessary for the project.
